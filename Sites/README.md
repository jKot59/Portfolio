The First work is a first site in my life. I did it responsive on pure html and css without JavaScript.

The look shop is my second work where i started use scss. Later i wanted rework it with using BEM and JavaScript. BEM and JS were applied to the slider and the menu 'CATEGORIES' in a page products.html

Both project you can test with the Visual Studio Code extension:  Live Server
